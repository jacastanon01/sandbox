Playing around with spotify-auth-flow. Currently it is designed to adhere to the [credentials flow](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/client-credentials-flow) since there is currently no client to authorize. A post request is made to `/api/token`with the necessary headers and grant type. The token is then stored using the flask session object and used in subsequent requests.
